# Goal is to finish this website by next saturday!

## Must have a good website that I can show to employers but mainly to finish this unit strong. 

### Here are some things I can do to be successful:

- have a website that uses good accessive qualities that make impaired people have an easier time.
- make a button that shows the different links everytime I click it
- have the website have an ordered style website!
- finally lets have fun :)

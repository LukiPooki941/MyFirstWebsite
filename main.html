        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <article>
        My name is Johnny 'long-toes' wilson and I was born in North Carolina on febuary 20th, 2005. I was from humble beginnings in a the redneck culture and was rejected by many accept my family. I love living in the wilderness hunting for bears with my pistol and squirrels with my 22 guage. What can I say Bears always win and squirrels don't. I felt that something was missing and that was the love of computers. I touched my first computer when I was working for Costco and was mesmorize about the cabablilties of this small machine such as the ability to search for millions of little texts that they call 'websites'. I was mesmorized on not just how the Smith website not only persauded with their jargon on how good their goggles were but the art work as well. Now I am learning all that i need to know on codecademy on website making!

        <article>
          The Cozey Tea Project was supposed to test my flexbox skills to make a homepage for a cafe. The only resource that was guiding me were specds for the projects which include the picture of the end result.

        <article>
          The mixed messages program wasn't as easy as it looks. I had to design a javascript program in which it would randomly produce mixed messages. Even though the javascript program was very simple, this project was the first time I used git to push my results into a github repository. I had to use commands thqat I havn't learned in the lesson because I mistakenly made a READme file on github instead of making it afterwards. After pushing commiting changes I finally was able to get the finished project in github. Note: the picture above is not the end result, You can find the actual code on the link above.

        <article>The most grueling project had to be the broken Fotomatic project. I had to not only fix the flexbox of this project, but also fix the responsive design. This was the only project where I had to not only finish in about a week, but also took an all nighter to finish the project</article>

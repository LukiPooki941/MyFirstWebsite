        <article>
        My name is Johnny 'long-toes' wilson and I was born in North Carolina on febuary 20th, 2005. I was from humble beginnings in a the redneck culture and was rejected by many accept my family. I love living in the wilderness hunting for bears with my pistol and squirrels with my 22 guage. What can I say Bears always win and squirrels don't. I felt that something was missing and that was the love of computers. I touched my first computer when I was working for Costco and was mesmorize about the cabablilties of this small machine such as the ability to search for millions of little texts that they call 'websites'. I was mesmorized on not just how the Smith website not only persauded with their jargon on how good their goggles were but the art work as well. Now I am learning all that i need to know on codecademy on website making!
